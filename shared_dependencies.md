Shared Dependencies:

1. Django Framework: All the files in the Django app share the Django framework as a dependency. 

2. PostgreSQL Database: The settings.py file will contain the configuration for the PostgreSQL database which will be used across the application.

3. Smartsheet API: The smartsheet_api.py file will contain the code to connect to the Smartsheet API. This will be used in views.py and data_updater.py.

4. Pandas Library: The smartsheet_api.py, excel_reader.py, data_comparer.py, and data_updater.py files will all use the pandas library for data manipulation.

5. Data Models: The models.py file will define the data models for the application. These models will be used in views.py, admin.py, and potentially in the utils files.

6. URLs: The urls.py file in the my_django_app directory will include the URLs from the data_handler/urls.py file. 

7. Views: The views.py file will contain the view functions for the application. These will be referenced in the data_handler/urls.py file.

8. Templates: The index.html and result.html files in the templates directory will be used in the views.py file to render the data.

9. Utils: The smartsheet_api.py, excel_reader.py, data_comparer.py, and data_updater.py files in the utils directory will contain utility functions that will be used in the views.py file.

10. DOM Elements: The index.html and result.html files will contain DOM elements that may be manipulated by JavaScript functions. These IDs will need to be consistent across the HTML and JavaScript files.

11. Message Names: Any messages used in the Django app (such as success or error messages) will need to be consistent across the views.py, models.py, and template files.

12. Function Names: Function names in the utils files and views.py file will need to be consistent where they are used across multiple files.
